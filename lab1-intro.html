<h1> Welcome to my webpage! </h1>
<p> For this assignment, I am learning how to build a basic webpage using HTML, or HyperText Markup Language. I am learning to use multiple elements and attributes to add detail to the page in the form of paragraphs (like this one), headings, images, and links. </p>

<p> Hello Professor Leasure! I hope that you are doing well, and I am <strong> very </strong> excited to be in this class! </p>
